			<span class="blogTitle"> Mar 10 - Christmas?</span>
			Packages came today! First a small box from Singapore containing $60 worth of displays. (not all for me...) 
			Funnily enough the contents were marked as a gift on the customs forms, but they were honest with the dollar amount.
			Next, two much larger boxes arrived from DuPont containing the sample Pyralux kaptan circuit board material that I requested 
			a couple of weeks ago. You have to give DuPont credit for being incredibly generous, I sent them an email asking if they would 
			be willing to sell/send me a single sheet of one of their cheaper products since you can't buy the stuff in small amounts from 
			distributors. After asking a few questions about my project they instead opted to send me 12sq. feet of two of their nicest materials. 
			Obviously they don't have smaller-sized boxes, the few sheets of each material came in a large box with a few inches of cardboard and
			plastic padding. I've uploaded a couple of images of the displays and kaptan on the media page. (A few were taken with my phone 
			camera and they're terribly fuzzy...)</br>

			<span class="blogTitle"> Mar 9 - Hardware Design & Spring Break</span>
			I've put together a "ToDo" list on the hardware page, indicating what and when things are going to have to be done. Along with that I've set 
			up the references page so that as I choose non-trivial components I'll be adding links to their datasheets there. </br>
			I'm going to try to get the component planning done over the spring break in addition to designing a few small breakout boards for
			the sensors and OLED display. The displays I ordered a few weeks ago should be arriving tomorrow and I want to set one of them up
			so I can prototype drivers.

			<span class="blogTitle"> Mar 5 - GitHub</span>
			There is now a public GitHub for this project at: <a href="https://github.com/BMellor/intelliDesk">https://github.com/BMellor/intelliDesk</a>

		<div class="blogPost"> 
			<span class="blogTitle"> Mar 5 - Website Up! </span>
			I've gotten the website (sorta) put together. Right now everything is just placeholders, but hopefully some content will start appearing over the next few weeks. 
			I'm planning to update this blog at least weekly to keep me on track with development (and to stop me from forgetting everything I just worked on... ) 
			I'm pretty lazy when it comes to this type of stuff, we'll have to see how the blog works out.
